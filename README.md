### This is a simple social media app I am making to teach myself Java Spring and an Angular!

#### The app takes into account, Dunbar’s number,” which is defined as "the number of stable relationships people are cognitively able to maintain at once. (The proposed number is 150)." [^1]

#### Tribe will limit the number of friends you can have to make your experience using the service more meaningful. One issue with social media these days comes from interaction with people who you don't really know, but follow anyway. Friends150 will be more like a small town, where the focus is on those closest to you.
